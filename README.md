# BPScreenshotTool
A prototype screenshot tool for Unreal Engine 5.1 to offer more control over the screenshot / render creation process.

This dockable Editor Widget offers improved control of the dimesions of your screenshot (including some presets) and the option to save screenshots to a chosen directory (other than the default folder in your project folder).

The tool was last tested in Unreal Engine 5.1.0 - will confirm functionality in later versions soon.

I plan on creating a new version with more features that is installable to the engine via the marketplace in the future but for now I'd like to provide this version for free to anyone who wants to try it out.

I'd appreciate any feedback, comments, ideas, suggestions etc.

##Installation Instructions

To install the screenshot tool, you need to download the source and add it to the Plugins directory of any project you want to use the tool in.
